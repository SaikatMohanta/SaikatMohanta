#About MySelf:

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @SaikatMohanta, a passionate PCB designer, MCU programmer, and product developer based in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. My journey in the world of technology revolves around my deep interest in Physics, Electronics, and Programming. Currently, I'm diving into the realms of C++, Python and PICmcu, constantly expanding my skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

ðŸ”Œ With expertise in PCB design, I love turning ideas into tangible electronic solutions. I thrive on the challenges of designing efficient and innovative circuits that bring concepts to life. As an MCU programmer, I enjoy crafting robust and optimized code that ensures seamless functionality.

ðŸŒ± When I'm not immersed in circuits and code, you can find me exploring new theoratical concepts in Physics and Cosmology (the study of the Universe) or brainstorming creative solutions to real-world problems. I believe in the power of technology to shape a better future.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at saikatmohantabkp@gmail.com. I also have an Youtube channel related to Coding and Electronics,
